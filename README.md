The main objective of the project given in course TPG42566- CO2 storage is to design a full chain offshore 
CO2 storage project, starting from industrial plants to capture the CO2 before emission to the 
atmosphere, to the transportation stage where different approaches can be utilized, ending up with 
storing the transported CO2 to a possibly permanent geological storage site. The annual rate of 5 million 
tonnes of CO2 needs to be injected in a chosen reservoir for 20 years, meaning in total, there should be a 
reservoir with a capacity of at least 100 million tonnes of CO2, undoubtedly in reservoir condition. The 
scope and methods in the project that needs to be answered are the following:
• The design should cover transport from the outlet from an onshore capture plant to an offshore 
platform situated over the selected storage site.
• Use analytical or semi-analytical methods and assume an ideal reservoir geometry
• The selected sites are chosen based on the site selection exercise, where the geology of the site 
should be based on published 'type wells or nearby exploration wells
• The design should specify pressures, flow rates, basic well design and number wells, and the 
compression stages from the capture plant to the wellhead and down to the reservoir
• The design should estimate the effective storage capacity, expected pressure limits and the 
expected storage efficiency for the chosen well placement system
• A reservoir monitoring programme should be specified. 
• Key project uncertainties and risks should be identified.
Everyone in the group has made an effort to meet all the tasks with reasons and arguments. To reach our 
goals, we tried to have different assumptions depending on the task, which is fair given that we had little 
tools available at our disposal. The project has been divided into different sections, where in all the tasks 
have been answered. The sections are the following:
• Johansen Formation Geology
• Reservoir Analytical Interpretation
• Capture Plants and Transportation
• Well Design and Compression Stages
• CO2 flow process
• Reservoir Monitoring Plan
• Uncertainties and Risks
• Final evaluation
